During the development of this project I used ChatGPT as a learning and support tool, not as a code generator. I designed and implemented 
the full application myself, such as structure, logic and styling. I used AI mainly to clarify syntax, verify ideas and get feedback on
specific details. Every part of the code was tested, understood and rewritten by me to fit the project's logic and requirements.

Before using AI, I already had a clear picture of how the app should work: how the data should flow, how each component should interact 
and what the user experience should be. I used AI only when I wanted to learn, verify or enhance specific parts of my implementation.

Here are a few examples of how I used AI responsibly during development:
- Styling and color: Since I'm not a designer, I asked ChatGPT to help me find color combinations that would match two main colors (dark blue
and red) that I chose.
- Calendar grid logic: When planning how to generate the calendar grid dynamically, I wanted to confirm that my approach using JavaScript Date object
to calculate the first and last days of the month, and fill up 42 cells, was efficient and accurate. I used AI to verify the logic behind this approach 
and then wrote and tested the implementation myself.
- Date labels: I wanted to display readable month labels like "November 2025". AI suggested using the toLocaleString/toLocaleDateString methods. I verified 
their behavior in the browser and adjusted them to fit my calendar structure.
- Time formatting: The data file contained event times in UTC format. I also wanted to display it in the user's local time, so I asked AI how to best achieve that.
I learned about using ISO date format, which makes converting between time zones much easier.
- Normalizing time strings: I wanted to ensure that all times included seconds. I asked AI how to check if a time string was in "HH:MM" format. AI suggested using
a regular expression. The regex checks that the string starts and ends with exactly two digits for hours, followed by a colon, then exactly two digits for minutes.
I implemented this in my own function to normalize time to include seconds.

Whenever I used AI, I didn't copy code directly. I treated it like a mentor, a way to confirm that I was on the right track. I tested every suggestion, rewrote 
it in my own way and cross-checked it with official documentation (React and MDN) to ensure accuracy.
